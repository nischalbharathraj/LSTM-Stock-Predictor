# LSTM-Stock-Predictor
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory .neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. LSTM is chosen for its ability to model sequences and capture temporal dependencies, making it well-suited for time series forecasting like stock prices. The project preprocesses the data by normalizing historical stock prices using MinMaxScaler to enhance model performance. It then creates sequences of data with a specified length, trains the LSTM model on the training dataset, and evaluates its performance on unseen test data. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer and trained to minimize the mean squared error loss function. Post-training, it generates predictions on test data and inversely transforms these predictions to the original scale for meaningful interpretation. Finally, the project visualizes both actual and predicted stock prices using matplotlib, providing insights into the model's accuracy and predictive capabilities
 WHY LSTM?
The main purpose of using Long Short-Term Memory networks, especially in projects like stock price prediction, is their ability to effectively capture and learn from sequential data with long-range dependencies.
